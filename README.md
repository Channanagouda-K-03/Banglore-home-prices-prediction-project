# Banglore-home-prices-prediction-project
Its an simple Realestate management system,
Some of the steps of this projects are,
1.Data collection 2.Data preprocessing 3.Data splitting into train and test data 4.Training the Machine Learning Model 5.Execution and Deployment.
Here i am using banglore home prices prediction dataset for the data, and 
In preprocessing i am cleaned the data using normalisation and removing null values from the dataset.
the data is divided into 80:20 % training:testing purpose,
Later i am choosing the best models by fine tuning,
then trained my model for estimating the price by giving the user needs such as bhk,bathroom and square feet and area,
then testing my models later executed perfectly and later deployment.
